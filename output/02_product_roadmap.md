# Product Roadmap for the Iris Classification Tool

## Vision
Develop a user-friendly interface that simplifies the classification of iris flower species for botanists, leveraging high-quality data and ensuring data integrity, accessibility, and compliance while promoting collaborative features.

## Timeline
**Phase 1: Research and User Engagement (Month 1-2)**  
- Conduct interviews with botanists to gather insights into their specific needs, pain points, and workflow.
- Develop user personas based on the findings.

**Phase 2: Feature Definition and Initial Prototyping (Month 3-4)**  
- Define core functionalities based on user requirements.
- Create low-fidelity prototypes for initial user testing.

**Phase 3: Development and Iterative Testing (Month 5-6)**  
- Build the Gradio interface with core features.
- Conduct user testing sessions for continuous feedback.

**Phase 4: Launch and Feedback Integration (Month 7)**  
- Launch the Iris Classification Tool.
- Gather user feedback for future enhancements.

## User Requirements Document

### User Needs
1. **Efficient Data Input**: Botanists need a straightforward method to input or select the iris metrics relevant for classification.
2. **Instant Feedback**: Users seek immediate classification suggestions based on input metrics to facilitate decision-making.
3. **Visual Aids**: Botanists require visual representations of data, such as graphs or images, to improve the classification experience.
4. **Database Access**: Easy access to a central repository of iris species data is required for validation and verification of classifications.
5. **Data Governance Compliance**: Users need assurance that data handling adheres to compliance standards (e.g., GDPR).

### Core Features for Gradio Interface
1. **Input Fields**: 
   - Interactive fields for entering sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
   - Dropdowns for guided selection based on common iris species.

2. **Real-time Classification**:
   - Instant results displaying predicted species and confidence scores for the classification.
   - Suggestions for species with similar metrics based on previous classifications.

3. **Visual Data Representations**:
   - Interactive graphs illustrating relationships between metric dimensions and species classifications.
   - Images of classified species for reference and validation.

4. **Documentation and Resources**:
   - User guides on how to use the tool effectively, including best practices for data input.
   - Links to botanical databases and relevant literature for thorough understanding.

5. **User Feedback Mechanism**:
   - Inline feedback options allowing botanists to report inaccuracies in classification or suggest additional features.
   - Anonymous surveys to assess user experience and satisfaction post-usage.

6. **Compliance and Security Features**:
   - Indicate data usage metrics and compliance status on the interface.
   - Implement role-based access controls to ensure data security and compliance standards.

## Success Metrics
1. **User Engagement Metrics**: Track the number of active users and frequency of tool usage to assess engagement levels.
2. **Classification Accuracy**: Monitor the accuracy of the model based on user-provided validation data over time.
3. **User Satisfaction Scores**: Aggregate feedback scores to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the interface.
4. **Data Integrity Scores**: Evaluate data quality based on feedback related to data accessibility and accuracy from user inputs.

## Conclusion
This product roadmap aims to create a sophisticated yet user-friendly Gradio interface tailored for botanists involved in iris classification. By closely aligning the tool's features with user needs, we can ensure high adoption rates and user satisfaction while maintaining the integrity and quality of our data practices.
